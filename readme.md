# About me

Machine Learning Researcher with a focus on Natural Language Processing and more than 5 years of experience in ML / AI Research and Development in big companies. 

- Graduated from Lomonosov Moscow State University as Mathematician in 2015.
- Published several papers on applications of Topological Data Analysis for improving the interpretability and quality of the Transformers while working in Huawei;
- Developed the prototype of an ML model for improving GNSS navigation on Android devices in the city canyon while working in Google;

- Aside from ML research and development experience, worked as C++(Qt) Software Developer for nearly a year in total.

I like to read and discuss the papers on Machine Learning (especially Natural Language Processing) and to learn about new achievements in this field. I'm glad to see how many abstract mathematical conceptions find an applications in this area of knowledge. You can ask me anything about my own research papers (see contacts at the bottom of the page).
